 Examples
                   12+76=88        18+(-43)=-25      -32+(+23)=-9   -32+-(89)=-121

Steps for adding integers
1.)	If it is a positive add a positive just leave it as is and do the math (the same thing with a negative add a negative, just add the negative sign). If it is a positive add a negative (or vice versa) turn it into a subtraction problem 
2.)	If it is a negative add a positive (vice versa) take away the signs because it is a subtraction problem and you can add the sign later.
3.)	Do the math!

Examples

            14*65=910     87*(-32)=-2784      -86*(+52)=    -23*(-56)=
Steps
1.)	There are four types of problems for multiplying integers: positive time’s positive, negative time’s negative, negative time’s positive, and positive times negative.
2.)	 For a positive times a positive and a negative times a negative take away the sign 
3.)	Then do the normal multiplication 
4.)	Add the positive sign because if it is the same sign it will be positive.

 On this page I will tell you how to multiply a negative times a positive and vice versa 
1.)	 multiply the absolute values 
2.)	The product of two positive integers or two negative integers is positive. The product of a positive integer and a negative integer is negative.

Examples
                 -2-3=-5   -4-3=-1   3-2=1  -9-(-4)=-13
There are four types of problems for subtracting integers, positive time’s positive, positive time’s negative, negative time’s positive, and negative time’s negative.
1.)	 For taking a positive away from a positive you first line them up vertically 
2.)	Next you do the subtraction like you would for normal subtraction

1.) For a negative minus a negative the first step is to line them up vertically 

2.) Next you would do turn the problem into addition because you can only add negative numbers not subtract 















 Subtracting Integers (continued) Page 8 

1.)	For subtracting a positive from a negative first lets picture a number line start at negative two
2.)	Then go three to the left
3.)	 You would end up at negative five

This go’s for a positive number minus a negative number, here are the steps.

1.)	 Let’s take  our number line again start at negative four 
2.)	Then go two to the right 
3.)	You would end up at negative two





















         Dividing Decimals    Page 10    

Examples
       

1.)	 If the divisor is not a whole number, move decimal point to right to make it a whole number and move decimal point in dividend the same number of places.
2.)	Divide as usual
3.)	Put decimal point directly above decimal point in the dividend.



  



















 Adding and Subtracting Fractions Page 1
Examples
             ½+½=1     2/3-2/3=0	
1.)	Find the smallest multiple (LCM) of both numbers
2.)	Rewrite the fractions as equivalent fractions with the LCM as the denominator
3.)	Then add or subtract the numerators 

























         Multiplying Fractions          Page 2
Examples


1.)	 multiply the two numerators together and the two denominators together
2.)	The new numerator is the product of the numerator in the first fraction and the second one.
3.)	The new denominator is the product of the denominator in the first fraction and the second one.

.
1.) Divide the numerator by the denominator
     2.) Write down the whole number answer
    3.) Then write down any remainder above the denominator.

Examples
             5.23+2.56=7.78  4.76-2.32=2.44
Subtracting 
1.)	 Put the numbers in a vertical column aligning the decimal points.  
2.)	Subtract each column, starting on the right and working left
3.)	Place the decimal point in the answer directly below the decimal points in the terms

Examples 
           8.50*4.25=   23.6*21.2= 500.32
    1.)  Multiply normally, ignoring the decimal points.
    2.) Then put the decimal point in the answer - it will have as many decimal places as the two original numbers combined.

                 -2÷3= 0.666    -3÷2= -1.5    -3÷(-5)= 0.6  3÷5= 0.6
1.) Always divide or the absolute values
     2.) The dividend of two positive integers or two negative integers is positive. The product of a positive integer and a negative integer is negative
