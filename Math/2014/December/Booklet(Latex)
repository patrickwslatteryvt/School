1.)     If it is a positive add a positive just leave it as is and do the math (the same thing with a negative add a negative, just add the negative sign). If it is a positive add a negative (or vice versa) turn it into a subtraction problem



2.)     If it is a negative add a positive (vice versa) take away the signs because it is a subtraction problem and you can add the sign later.

3.)     Do the math!

                           Examples

            14*65=910     87*(-32)=-2784      -86*(+52)=    -23*(-56)=
Steps
1.)     There are four types of problems for multiplying integers: positive time’s positive, negative time’s negative, negative time’s positive, and positive times negative.
2.)      For a positive times a positive and a negative times a negative take away the sign 
3.)     Then do the normal multiplication 
4.)     Add the positive sign because if it is the same sign it will be positive.

        Multiplying Integers (continued) Page 12      

 On this page I will tell you how to multiply a negative times a positive and vice versa 
1.)      multiply the absolute values 
2.)     The product of two positive integers or two negative integers is positive. The product of a positive integer and a negative integer is negative.
